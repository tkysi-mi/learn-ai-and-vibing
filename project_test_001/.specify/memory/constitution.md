# learn-ai-and-vibing Constitution

<!-- Initial Ratification -->

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality

**Comments MUST be written in Japanese.**
**Every function MUST have a documentation comment (docstring) explaining its purpose.**

Rationale: To ensure maintainability and clarity for Japanese-speaking developers, and to guarantee that all code is self-documenting.

### II. User Experience (UI/UX)

**UI text MUST be in Japanese.**
**The design MUST prioritize simplicity.**
**Workflows SHOULD aim to be completed within a single screen (avoiding excessive navigation).**

Rationale: To provide an intuitive and efficient user experience that minimizes cognitive load and navigation friction.

### III. Technical Strategy

**Use of external libraries SHOULD be minimized.**
**Standard APIs MUST be prioritized over third-party solutions.**

Rationale: To reduce dependency bloat, improve long-term maintainability, and leverage the stability of standard platform capabilities.

## Governance

**Status**: This Constitution supersedes all ad-hoc decisions.
**Amendments**: Changes to these principles require a version bump and documented rationale.
**Compliance**: ALL Pull Requests and Architecture Plans MUST be verified against these principles.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-30 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-30
